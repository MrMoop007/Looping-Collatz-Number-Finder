This program searches through numbers in the Collatz conjecture. If you're unfamiliar, the Collatz function is defined as f(n) = {3n+1 if the number is odd. | n/2 if the number is even.}. The Collatz conjecture is that there is no number which does not decay to 1 after a finite number of applications of the Collatz function. This program takes a theoretical number n, and applies each form of the Collatz function randomly. It then sets this equal to n, and solves for n. If the number found is a whole integer, then this solves for a number which loops in the Collatz conjecture. In my own testing, I have found none which don't also pass through 1, which means the original conjecture still holds.

The program is not particularly user friendly at this point, but I have left instructions on how to use it in the comments
